# About

DeusFramework serves primarily as a bare bones module loader with few bloat modules and a result has no services of its own. CardinalEngine is a higher-level module loader built on DeusFramework and provides basic services for managing DeusFramework modules.

DeusFramework is able to be used independently from CardinalEngine
